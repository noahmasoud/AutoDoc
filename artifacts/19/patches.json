      "diff_after": "# API Documentation Update\n\n## Breaking Change Notice\n\n### `refund_payment` Function - REMOVED\n\n**Summary**: The `refund_payment` function has been permanently removed from the payment API.\n\n**Purpose**: This function previously provided a simple boolean-based refund mechanism for payment transactions. It has been deprecated and removed in favor of more robust refund processing methods.\n\n**Parameters** (Previously):\n- `transaction_id` (str): ID of the transaction to refund\n  - Required, non-empty string\n  - Must be a valid transaction identifier\n\n**Returns** (Previously):\n- `bool`: Always returned `False` (indicating the function was non-functional)\n\n**Example Usage** (No longer available):\n```python\n# ❌ This will now raise a NameError\nresult = refund_payment(\"txn_12345\")\n```\n\n**Migration Guide**:\nUse the following alternative functions for refund operations:\n\n1. **For simple refunds with validation**:\n```python\n# ✅ Use refund_payment_safe instead\nresult = refund_payment_safe(\"txn_12345\", 99.99)\nif result[\"status\"] == \"failed\":\n    print(f\"Refund failed: {result['error']}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Refund status: {result['refund_status']}\")\n```\n\n2. **For complex refund workflows**:\n```python\n# ✅ Use process_refund_request for full refund processing\nresult = process_refund_request(\n    payment_id=\"txn_12345\",\n    reason=\"Customer requested refund\",\n    amount=99.99  # Optional: None for full refund\n)\n```\n\n**Notes**:\n- **Breaking Change**: Any code calling `refund_payment()` will fail with `NameError`\n- **Immediate Action Required**: Update all references to use `refund_payment_safe()` or `process_refund_request()`\n- **Removed in**: Commit `567b88bd` on `dev` branch\n- The removed function was non-functional (always returned `False`), so this removal improves API reliability\n- Consider `refund_payment_safe()` for most use cases as it includes proper validation and error handling\n\n---\n\n## Also Removed\n\n### `process_refund_request` Function - REMOVED\n\n**Summary**: The `process_refund_request` function for handling refund workflows has also been removed.\n\n**Migration**: Use `refund_payment_safe()` which provides comprehensive refund processing with validation.\n\nHello From Claude!
