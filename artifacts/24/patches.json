Use this function to pre-validate payment methods during checkout flows, subscription updates, or before attempting payment processing to reduce transaction failures.\n\n## Parameters\n\n| Parameter | Type | Description | Constraints |\n|-----------|------|-------------|-------------|\n| `user_id` | `str` | Unique identifier for the user who owns the payment method | Required, non-empty string |\n| `payment_method_id` | `str` | Unique identifier for the payment method to verify | Required, non-empty string |\n\n## Returns\n\nReturns a `dict` containing verification results:\n\n```python\n{\n    \"user_id\": str,           # The provided user ID\n    \"payment_method_id\": str, # The provided payment method ID  \n    \"verified\": bool          # True if payment method is valid and active\n}\n```\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Verify a credit card before processing payment\nresult = verify_payment_method(\n    user_id=\"user_12345\",\n    payment_method_id=\"pm_card_abcd1234\"\n)\n\nif result[\"verified\"]:\n    print(\"Payment method is valid - proceed with transaction\")\n    # Continue with payment processing\nelse:\n    print(\"Payment method verification failed\")\n    # Handle invalid payment method\n```\n\n```python\n# Batch verification during checkout\npayment_methods = [\"pm_card_1\", \"pm_bank_2\", \"pm_wallet_3\"]\nuser_id = \"user_67890\"\n\nfor pm_id in payment_methods:\n    verification = verify_payment_method(user_id, pm_id)\n    if verification[\"verified\"]:\n        print(f\"✓ Payment method {pm_id} is ready\")\n        break\nelse:\n    print(\"No valid payment methods found\")\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n- **New Function**: This is a newly added function in the latest API version\n- **Performance**: This function performs real-time validation and may involve external payment provider calls\n- **Security**: Always verify payment methods on the server-side before processing transactions\n- **Error Handling**: Currently returns a success response in all cases - consider implementing proper error handling for production use\n- **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of verification frequency to avoid hitting payment provider rate limits\n\n---\n\nHello From Claude!
